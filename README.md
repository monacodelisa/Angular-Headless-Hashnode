# Angular Headless Hashnode
## [![Discord](https://github.com/monacodelisa/icons-and-graphics/blob/main/icomoon/PNG/discord.png?raw=true)](https://discord.gg/3bS3xpCj) Open Source Project 

## Overview 

The **Angular Headless Hashnode Project** aims to seamlessly connect your Angular application to the Hashnode GraphQL database, providing a template for integrating Angular with a headless Hashnode setup.

In other words - this project is very much like the starter kit that Hashnode provides, except that this project uses Angular for the frontend and deployment is set to be done through Netlify.

## Project Goals

- Develop a flexible template for Angular integration with headless Hashnode.
- Connect the Angular app to Hashnode's GraphQL database to retrieve posts and blog data.
- Responsive layout improvements for different devices
- Support Angular v17 and up

## Existing Setup & Features

- [Appolo Angular](https://the-guild.dev/graphql/apollo-angular/docs) - GraphQL Client for Angular
- [Font Awesome Icons](https://fontawesome.com/)
- [Google Material Symbols and Icons](https://fonts.google.com/icons)

## Using the app with your Hashnode Blog

This app is still in its early stages, and it currently has limited features. At this point, I strongly encourage you to contribute to its development before actively using the app.

### Fork the repository

1. [Fork](https://docs.github.com/en/github/getting-started-with-github/fork-a-repo) the `monacodelisa/angular-headles-hashnopde` repo.

2. Go to your chosen app version, and inside the `graphql.operations.ts` file, replace the URL of the blog to point to your blog.

3. All three app versions can be deployed to Netlify or Vercel, so you just need to select an app version and deploy from an existing GitHub repo. (Your forked repo)

Be advised that a lot of features are yet to be implemented.

### Run locally

1. Clone this repository.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/angular-headless-hashnode.git
cd angular-headless-hashnode
```
2. Select one of the available [app versions](#angular-app-versions)
```
cd <chosen-app-version>
```

3. Install dependencies.

```
npm install
```

4. Run the app 

```
npm start
```

or 

```
ng serve
```
